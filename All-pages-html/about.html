              <p>
                Hi, I’m <strong>Adarsh Jayprakash Mishra</strong>, the founder of Mail Karo.
                I come from a software testing and quality-focused background, where
                attention to detail, usability, and user trust matter more than hype.
              </p>

              <p>
                Over time, I noticed that writing professional emails often feels harder
                than it should. Not because people lack skill, but because they overthink
                tone, wording, and structure.
              </p>

              <p>
                Mail Karo was created to solve that exact problem — to help people write
                clear, confident emails without stress, shortcuts, or privacy trade-offs.

        <!-- ABOUT CONTENT -->
        <section class="mk-about-block">
          <h2>Why Mail Karo Exists</h2>
          <p>
            Communication should be simple. Yet emails often become a source of anxiety,
            especially in professional or academic situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mail Karo exists to remove that friction. It focuses on clarity, intent,
            and context — helping users express themselves naturally instead of sounding
            robotic or over-polished.
          </p>

        <section class="mk-about-block">
          <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            Mail Karo is built on a few simple principles:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clarity is more important than complexity</li>
            <li>User trust is non-negotiable</li>
            <li>Privacy should be the default, not a feature</li>
            <li>Small improvements compound over time</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mk-about-block">
          <h2>Who It’s For</h2>
          <p>
            Mail Karo is designed for students, professionals, founders,
            and anyone who wants to communicate better through email —
            without overthinking every sentence.
